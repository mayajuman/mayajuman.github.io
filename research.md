### Anthropogenic and Ecological Drivers of Zoonotic Spillover from Bats

My PhD research at the University of Cambridge (advised by <a href="https://www.vet.cam.ac.uk/directory/or226%40cam.ac.uk" target="_blank">Dr. Olivier Restif</a>) focuses on modeling viral dynamics in Ghanaian and Australian fruit bat populations. I am currently analyzing paramyxovirus and filovirus serology in *Eidolon helvum*, and its relationship to the ecology and demography of this enigmatic, highly mobile species. This research will hopefully inform both bat conservation efforts and local public health measures.

### Biogeography, Taxonomy, and Conservation of South and Southeast Asian Mammals

My undergraduate thesis and ongoing related projects grew out of a <a href="https://news.yale.edu/2018/09/14/yale-smithsonian-internships-offer-exciting-research-opportunities" target="_blank">Yale-Smithsonian internship</a> I completed in 2018, focusing on ecogeographic variation in treeshrews (Scandentia). In collaboration with <a href="https://meml.yale.edu/" target="_blank">Dr. Eric Sargis</a> at Yale and <a href="http://linkolson.org/" target="_blank">Dr. Link Olson</a> at UAF, I analyze multivariate morphometric data from museum specimens to clarify taxonomic boundaries and conservation priorities for these poorly studied mammals. We also use these data to investigate the effects of latitude and island biogeography on body size and shape in treeshrews.

I grew up in India and am passionate about South Asian wildlife conservation. I serve as a species page contributor for Scandentia on the <a href="https://indiabiodiversity.org/" target="_blank">India Biodiversity Portal</a>, and am the founder and administrator of the <a href="https://indiabiodiversity.org/group/Small_Mammals_of_India" target="_blank">Small Mammals of India micro-site</a>, a hub for aggregating citizen science data.

### Cryptic Speciation in Malagasy Snakes

<p align=left>Previously I worked with <a href="https://sararuane.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Sara Ruane</a>, then at the AMNH Department of Herpetology, on the morphology and ecology of Malagasy snakes (see our project featured <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk3JBFs1arQ" target="_blank">here</a>!). Our work culminated in the description of a new cryptic species, <i>Mimophis occultus</i>, based on an integrative analysis of molecular and morphological data.</p>
