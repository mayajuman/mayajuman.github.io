At Yale, I investigated Southeast Asian treeshrew taxonomy with <a href="https://meml.yale.edu/" target="_blank">Dr. Eric Sargis</a>. We analyzed multivariate morphometric data from museum specimens to explore ecogeographic variation in these poorly-studied mammals. My senior thesis grew out of a <a href="https://news.yale.edu/2018/09/14/yale-smithsonian-internships-offer-exciting-research-opportunities" target="_blank">Yale-Smithsonian internship</a> I completed in 2018, supplemented by additional data collection in 2019 from specimens at six natural history museums. This work was supported by the Yale College Dean's Research Fellowship, the Tetelman Fellowship for International Research, the Yale Summer Environmental Fellowship, and the Saybrook College Richter Fellowship.

Previously I worked with Dr. Sara Ruane, then at the AMNH Department of Herpetology, on cryptic speciation in Malagasy snakes (see our project featured <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk3JBFs1arQ" target="_blank">here</a>!). Our work together culminated in the description of a new species, *Mimophis occultus*, based on an integrative analysis of molecular and morphological data.
