Over the past few years I’ve had a lot of fun exploring ways to make science more accessible through various media (blogs, photography, video, audio, etc.). Check out some of my projects here!

### Inkredible: A Cephalopodcast

I wrote, hosted, and produced a podcast episode all about cephalopod ink as a final project for Dr. Casey Dunn’s Invertebrate Zoology class at Yale (Fall 2019). You can find my podcast on SoundCloud, Spotify, or Apple Podcasts. There’s also extra content and photos available on the podcast website. In February 2020, I delivered a related gallery talk at the Yale Peabody Museum on cephalopod ink.
