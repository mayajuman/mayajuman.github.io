Over the past few years I’ve had a lot of fun exploring ways to make science more accessible through various media (blogs, photography, video, audio, etc.). Check out some of my projects here!

### Inkredible: A Cephalopodcast

I wrote, hosted, and produced a podcast episode all about cephalopod ink as a final project for Dr. Casey Dunn’s Invertebrate Zoology class at Yale (Fall 2019). You can find my podcast on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/maya-juman/inkredible-a-cephalopodcast" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0JaFabsUnukuNOMlKrkq1E" target="_blank">Spotify</a>, or <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/inkredible-a-cephalopodcast/id1490214137" target="_blank">Apple Podcasts</a>. There’s also extra content and photos available on the <a href="https://inkrediblepod.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">podcast website</a>. In February 2020, I delivered a related gallery talk at the Yale Peabody Museum on cephalopod ink.
