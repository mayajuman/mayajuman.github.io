Over the past few years I’ve had a lot of fun exploring ways to make science more accessible through various media (blogs, photography, video, audio, etc.). Check out some of my projects here!

### Inkredible: A Cephalopodcast

I wrote, hosted, and produced a podcast episode all about cephalopod ink as a final project for Dr. Casey Dunn’s Invertebrate Zoology class at Yale (Fall 2019). You can find my podcast on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/maya-juman/inkredible-a-cephalopodcast" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0JaFabsUnukuNOMlKrkq1E" target="_blank">Spotify</a>, or <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/inkredible-a-cephalopodcast/id1490214137" target="_blank">Apple Podcasts</a>. There’s also extra content and photos available on the <a href="https://inkrediblepod.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">podcast website</a>. In February 2020, I delivered a related gallery talk at the Yale Peabody Museum on cephalopod ink.

### Yale Peabody Museum Tour Guide

<p align=left>I led behind-the-scenes tours of the Peabody’s Invertebrate Paleontology collections for four years! One of my tours was featured in New Haven’s very own <a href="http://dailynutmeg.com/2018/01/25/peabody-museum-behind-scenes-grand-tour/" target="_blank">Daily Nutmeg</a>. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I filmed a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qENRyMooXs" target="_blank">remote "tour"</a> from home, which was shared with intro biology students at Yale (BIO 104: Ecology and Evolutionary Biology) as a supplemental class resource. Outside of tours, I worked in both Invertebrate and Vertebrate Paleontology as a collections assistant during my time at Yale (see my student spotlight <a href="https://peabody.yale.edu/education/maya-juman-student-spotlight" target="_blank">here</a>!).</p>
