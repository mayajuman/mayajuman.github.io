Over the past few years I’ve had a lot of fun exploring ways to make science more accessible through various media. Check out some of my projects below!

### Inkredible: A Cephalopodcast

I wrote, hosted, and produced a podcast episode about cephalopod ink as a final project for Dr. Casey Dunn’s Invertebrate Zoology class at Yale (Fall 2019). You can find my podcast on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0JaFabsUnukuNOMlKrkq1E" target="_blank">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/inkredible-a-cephalopodcast/id1490214137" target="_blank">Apple Podcasts</a>, or <a href="https://soundcloud.com/maya-juman/inkredible-a-cephalopodcast" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a>. There’s also extra content and photos available on the <a href="https://inkrediblepod.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">podcast website</a>. In February 2020, I delivered a related gallery talk at the Yale Peabody Museum.

### Taming of the (Tree) Shrew

I maintained <a href="https://tamingofthetreeshrew.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">this blog</a> during my Yale-Smithsonian summer internship in 2018. It is a mixture of research updates, musings on taxonomy, recipes, and descriptions of life as a Smithsonian intern.

### Yale Peabody Museum Tour Guide

<img src="/public/tour.jpg" alt="tour" align="left" style="margin: 10px 10px 0px 0px; width:230px">

<p align=left>I led behind-the-scenes tours of the Peabody’s Invertebrate Paleontology collections for four years! One of my tours was featured in New Haven’s very own <a href="http://dailynutmeg.com/2018/01/25/peabody-museum-behind-scenes-grand-tour/" target="_blank">Daily Nutmeg</a>. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I filmed a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qENRyMooXs" target="_blank">remote "tour"</a> from home, which was shared with intro biology students at Yale (BIO 104: Ecology and Evolutionary Biology) as a supplemental class resource. Outside of tours, I worked in both Invertebrate and Vertebrate Paleontology as a collections assistant during my time at Yale (see my student spotlight <a href="https://www.facebook.com/YalePeabodyMuseum/posts/our-first-student-spotlight-of-the-year-is-maya-juman-maya-is-a-senior-in-saybro/10157914017949429/" target="_blank">here</a>!).</p>

### Letters to a Pre-Scientist

Since 2021, I've served as a Pen Pal as part of the <a href="https://prescientist.org/" target="_blank">Letters to a Pre-Scientist</a> (LPS) program. LPS matches middle school students in low-income communities with STEM professionals for a yearlong exchange of letters discussing what a science career (and a scientist!) can look like. It's been incredibly rewarding and I highly recommend participating as a pen pal if you are a STEM professional interested in science communication.

### ATHENA Podcast

<a href="https://www.abwis.org/home" target="_blank">ATHENA by Women in STEM</a> is an organization working to make science research accessible to underrepresented and low-income female and genderqueer students, founded by two high schoolers. Check out my interview about diversity in STEM and the college experience <a href="https://www.abwis.org/podcast" target="_blank">on their podcast</a>.

### Peabody Portraits

I created a portfolio of original DSLR images of the Peabody Museum paleontology collections, which I presented as a final project for a digital photography class at the Yale School of Art in December 2019. This series focused on juxtapositions of the organic and the artificial in natural history museums. Here are a few of my favorite images:
