title: About Me
---

I am an aspiring evolutionary biologist, interested in island biogeography, species delimitation, conservation, and natural history collections. <a href="research">My research</a> thus far has spanned herpetology and mammalogy, phylogenetics and morphometrics, Madagascar and Southeast Asia… but has always relied heavily on museum collections.

I currently work for the Philadelphia Department of Public Health, coordinating COVID-19 contact tracing and assisting with software development and data management. Later this year (COVID-dependent) I'm headed to Malaysia on a Fulbright research grant, where I'll be studying deforestation and sustainable agriculture in Peninsular Malaysia. I plan to apply for admission to PhD programs in the 2021-2022 cycle.

When I’m not doing science, you can find me struggling through a New York Times crossword, playing the guitar, or daydreaming about future travel.
