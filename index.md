title: About Me
---

I am an aspiring evolutionary biologist, interested in disease ecology, biogeography, conservation, and natural history collections. <a href="research">My research</a> thus far has spanned herpetology and mammalogy; phylogenetics and morphometrics; and Madagascar and Southeast Asia, always relying heavily on museum collections.

In the fall of 2022, I'll be starting my PhD in Biology at the University of Cambridge as a <a href="https://www.gatescambridge.org/biography/18513/" target="_blank">Gates Cambridge Scholar</a>. My PhD research will focus on anthropogenic and ecological drivers of zoonotic emergence from bat populations.

When Iâ€™m not doing science, you can find me biking along the Schuylkill River, struggling through a New York Times crossword, or daydreaming about future travel.
