title: About Me
---

I am an aspiring evolutionary biologist, broadly interested in mammal biodiversity, disease ecology, and conservation--particularly questions that lie at the intersection of public and planetary health. I hold a B.S. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from Yale University, and am now working toward a PhD in Biological Sciences at the University of Cambridge as a <a href="https://www.gatescambridge.org/biography/18513/" target="_blank">Gates Cambridge Scholar</a>.

Thanks for stopping by!
